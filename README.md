# MMM-OneCallWeather

This is another weather module for [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror). It is based somewhat around <https://github.com/jharttech/MMM-weatherforecast> and the default 'weather' app. This version has been edited to allow the days of the week to span left to right, each with its own weather icon and details.

The app uses data from the currently-free source of openweathermap.org, using their one-call API - <https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api>.

## Project status

Since the original author of the module, [Captsi](https://github.com/Captsi), is no longer active, I forked the module. I fixed a few issues and will try to keep the module working in the future.

**This module is in maintenance mode.** So I'm not planning any functional changes. If someone wants to take over the further development, I would be happy. PR's are welcome too!

## Installation

In your terminal, go to your MagicMirror's module folder:

```sh
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
```

Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/KristjanESPERANTO/MMM-OneCallWeather
```

Install the dependencies:

```sh
cd MMM-OneCallWeather
npm install
```

Go to <https://openweathermap.org/api> and subscribe to One Call API. Its free to set up an account, and the free subscription level is fine for this app. The API returns a lot of information and can return 1000 calls a day on the free subscription level (approx once every 2 minutes maximum). The API is good as it uses their algorithms to give ultra local weather reports, even if you don't live in a named location, which some other apps suffer with.

Go to <https://www.latlong.net/> and figure out where you want the forecast for. There are plenty of ways of figuring out your location, and you just need a decimal format of your position. 52N 010W becomes 52.0 -10.0 on the two lines in your config.

## Notes

Icons used in this module were created by:

VClouds Weather Icons
Created and copyrighted by VClouds - <http://vclouds.deviantart.com/>

The icons are free to use for Non-Commercial use and can be found at icons DA page - <http://vclouds.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d2ynulp>

Note: You can use any of your own icons but you will have to rename them to the weather items shown on openweather. There are only 9 types of weather that the API currently shows (2021) and they are shown on <https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions>. With some different icons for day and night you should have 18 icons in each folder, some of which will just be copies.

This module displays the weather forecast for the coming week, including an an icon to display the current conditions, the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature. The software is designed around a display in Celsius and miles per hour, but should work in a multitude of units. I found that the openweathermap information is a bit crude in that you cant have Farenheight and metres per second, or celsius and miles per hour, hence this code. Its a bit clunky.

## Using the module

To use this module, add it to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:

```javascript
modules: [
  {
    module: "MMM-OneCallWeather",
    position: "top_right", // This can be any of the regions.
    // Best results in bottom_bar region due to horizontal default layout and icon sizes.
    config: {
      // See 'Configuration options' for more information.
      latitude: "51.500149", // Longitude from https://www.latlong.net/
      longitude: "-0.126240", // Longitude from https://www.latlong.net/ - is West + is East of London
      apikey: "YOUR_API_KEY" // openweathermap.org API key.
    }
  }
];
```

## Configuration options

The following properties can be configured:

| `iconsetFormat`              | The format of the symbols in the above iconset folders. The module can't parse the filetype of the icons so you have to tell it what type it is. MagicMirror is pretty flexible with image types. If you have some funky icons try them out<br><br> **Possible values:** `png`, `svg` or any other image file type.<br> **Default value:** `png`.                               |

(Milliseconds) <br><br> **Possible values:** `1000` - `5000` <br> **Default value:** `2500` (2.5 seconds delay. This delay is used to keep the OpenWeather API happy.)                                                                   |
| `appendLocationNameToHeader` | If set to `true`, the returned location name will be appended to the header of the module, if the header is enabled. This is mainly intresting when using calender based weather. <br><br> **Default value:** `true`                                                                                                                                                            |

| `colored`                    | If set 'colored' to true the min-temp get a blue tone and the max-temp get a red tone. <br><br> **Default value:** `true`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
